Real vs. Fake Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras for the classification of images into real and fake categories. The model is trained on a dataset containing real and fake images, and it learns to distinguish between the two based on visual features. OpenCV is utilized for image processing tasks such as resizing and normalization. The project also includes an interactive mode with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter, allowing users to choose an image for real-time classification. The CNN model is evaluated using binary cross-entropy loss and accuracy metrics, providing insights into its performance on the given task. The project combines machine learning, computer vision, and interactive programming for effective real vs. fake image detection.
